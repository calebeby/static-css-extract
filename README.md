# static-css-extract

Idea: A css extractor for css in js: write css in js, extract it to .css files (like [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), but not dependent on Babel, and much faster)

don't use

This was just an experiment, I am now reimplementing the idea at https://github.com/calebeby/severed
